Description: This model is based on the engineering drawings of a hybrid B737/757 aircraft fire training rig manufactured by Simulation FTS Ltd in the UK. The original is dual fuelled (kerosene and LPG) and can be set up to simulate a wide range of common aircraft fire scenarios. Similar models can be seen at several UK airports.
