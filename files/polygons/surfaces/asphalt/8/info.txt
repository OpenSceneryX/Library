=====================
Description: A semi-transparent asphalt surface, suitable for draping over runways and taxiways to give a more faded appearance, which is more appropriate for older asphalt. This version gives a lighter appearance than [/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/2/](/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/2/), [/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/3/](/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/3/), [/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/4/](/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/4/), [/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/5/](/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/5/), [/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/6/](/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/6/) and [/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/7/](/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/7/).
