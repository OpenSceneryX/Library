=====================
Description: A semi-transparent asphalt surface, suitable for draping over runways and taxiways to give a lighter, more faded appearance, which is more appropriate for older asphalt. This version gives a lighter appearance than [/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/2/](/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/2/) and darker than [/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/4/](/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/4/).
