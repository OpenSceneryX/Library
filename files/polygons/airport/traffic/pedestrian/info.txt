Description: A surface marking depicting a 'Pedestrians Only' symbol. Typically used to identify passenger walkways to aircraft on aprons.

This polygon uses the NOWRAP texture command so that the texture will fill what ever size you make the polygon without repeating. The polygon should be sized so that the whole polygon, including transparency, is square and the symbol within it is 0.8 - 1.2m tall (use the developer's 10m grid polygon also available in this library to aid placement).
