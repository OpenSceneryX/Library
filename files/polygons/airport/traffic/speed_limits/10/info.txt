=====================
Description: A surface marking depicting an inline '10' speed limit sign.

This polygon uses the NOWRAP texture command so that the texture will fill what ever size you make the polygon without repeating. The polygon should be sized so that the whole polygon, including transparency, twice as tall as it is wide and the spped limit symbol within it is 4.4m long (use the developer's 10m grid polygon also available in this library to aid placement).
