Description: A white surface marking depicting an inline 'Bus Stop' traffic lane instruction/advisory on two rows.

This polygon uses the NOWRAP texture command so that the texture will fill what ever size you make the polygon without repeating. The polygon should be sized so that the whole polygon, including transparency, is square and the letters within it are 1.6 - 3.2m tall (use the developer's 10m grid polygon also available in this library to aid placement).
