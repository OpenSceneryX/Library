Description: A surface marking depicting 'No Entry' warning using white letters on a red background. This supplementary warning may be used at the exit point of a taxiway that normally allows traffic in one direction only such as a runway's rapid exit taxiway (RET).

This polygon uses the NOWRAP texture command so that the texture will fill what ever size you make the polygon without repeating. The polygon should be sized so that the whole polygon, including transparency, is 10m wide with the letters within it are 2m tall (use the developer's 10m grid polygon also available in this library to aid placement).
