Description: A square yellow background paint with black border for use in location and direction taxiway signs. This polygon uses the Texture_NoWrap command so that the sign background will assume the shape of the four-sided polygon you draw.

This polygon is drawn at an appropriate level relative to other OpenSceneryX ground taxiway sign components according to the following hierarcy:

Level Markings +3 : All Glyphs / Characters
                    Taxisign Border Yellow (line)

                    Background Black_Square, Background Yellow_Square
