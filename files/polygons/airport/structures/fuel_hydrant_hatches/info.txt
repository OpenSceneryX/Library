Description: An access hatch for an in-ground fuel hydrant with surrounding yellow warning marking.

This draped polygon uses the NOWRAP texture command so that the texture will fill what ever size you make the polygon without repeating. A realistic size would be about 1.5m across for th whole polygon, including tranparent section (use the developer's 10m grid polygon also available in this library to aid placement).

This polygon is drawn at the 'Runways +5' level so should appear above all runway/taxiway surfaces but below any 'painted' markings.
