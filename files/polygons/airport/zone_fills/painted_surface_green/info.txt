Description: A repeating solid-coloured surface marking depicting green painted concrete or asphalt. Typically used to fill in an area that aircraft should not enter on the airport apron or between closely situated taxiways, especially taxiway 'islands', when simple taxiway edge/shoulder markings alone may be cofusing or unclear.

This polygon is drawn at the 'Runways -1' level so will appear below all  default markings in X-Plane generated by apt.dat files.
