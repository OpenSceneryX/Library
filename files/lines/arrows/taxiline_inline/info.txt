=====================
Description: An arrow with pointer only, approx 1m long, to be used as an inline directional indicator for taxiway centrelines. Typically used on centrelines within stands used for entrance/exit only. When placing, ensure your custom line is between 2-6m long so that the whole arrow appears but is not repeated (unless repetition is desired!).

This line is drawn at the 'Markings 0' level so that its black and yellow elements integrate correctly with the default taxiway centreline graphics.
