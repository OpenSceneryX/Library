=====================
Description: An arrow with pointer and root, approx 2m long, to be used as a stand-alone or end-of-centreline directional indicator. Typically used at the entrance point to an aircraft stand in association with a stand entrance identifier. When placing, ensure your custom line is between 2-6m long so that the whole arrow appears but is not repeated.

This line is drawn at the 'Markings 0' level so that its black and yellow elements integrate correctly with the default taxiway centreline graphics.
