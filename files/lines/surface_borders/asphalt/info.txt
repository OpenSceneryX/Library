=====================
Description: Rough asphalt edge useful for making boundaries between asphalt and other surfaces look more natural.

To use this border, place a polygon using an [asphalt surface](/polygons/surfaces/asphalt/1), then place a line using the same coordinates as the edge of this surface.
