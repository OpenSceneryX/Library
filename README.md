The OpenSceneryX project is a free to use library of scenery objects for the [X-PlaneÂ® flight simulator](https://www.x-plane.com). It is a collaborative effort by members of the [X-Plane.org](https://forums.x-plane.org) community, providing a range of high quality scenery components for authors to use in their scenery packages.

The library contains many pre-built 3d models including buildings, aircraft and vehicles as well as a large collection of ground markings, ground furniture and vegetation.

This repository contains the main library, with associated build and maintenance scripts written using a mixture of Python 3 and shell script.
