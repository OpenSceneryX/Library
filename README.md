# OpenSceneryX Library

The OpenSceneryX project is a free to use library of scenery objects for the X-PlaneÂ® flight simulator. It is a collaborative effort by members of the X-Plane.org community, providing a range of high quality scenery components for authors to use in their scenery packages.

The library contains many pre-built 3d models including buildings, aircraft and vehicles as well as a large collection of ground markings, ground furniture and trees from both Europe and America.

This repository contains the main library, with associated build and maintenance scripts written using a mixture of Python 2 and shell script.
