  <p>The OpenSceneryX project is a library of scenery objects for X-Plane v8.50 and above.  It is a collaborative effort by members of the <a href='http://www.x-plane.org'>X-Plane.org</a> community and the aim is to provide a good range of scenery components for authors to use in their scenery packages.</p>
  
  <p>An index of all the objects in the current version is available down the right hand side of this page.  Roll over them to see a screenshot of each object and click to view some more information about the object.  Note that you cannot download single objects, you must download the library as a whole.</p>

  <h2>Use</h2>
  
  <h3>Normal X-Plane Users</h3>
  <p>If you are a standard user of X-Plane, then you don't do anything else. Installing this library does nothing <strong>on it's own</strong> to the simulator - you won't see new objects dotted about, you won't see any changes to your default scenery, you won't see any new options in X-Plane.  However, scenery packages developed by other people can now use the objects in this library, so if you have installed any scenery package marked 'Enhanced by OpenSceneryX' then that package will come alive with objects.</p>
