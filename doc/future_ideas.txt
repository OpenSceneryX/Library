Future Ideas List
=================

Installer
---------

o Detect version of X-Plane installed and install DDS textures if X-Plane 9 detected

o Detect which objects are used in the user's installed scenery packages, and only install those

o Split library into multiple, optional packages


Library
-------

o Split library into multiple, optional packages


Website
-------

âˆš Build script should build sitemap.xml

o Obfuscation of email addresses on site 

o Add 'last modified' date handling to build script?

o Promote latest objects, possibly with screenshots

o The sub-categories section of category landing pages should be better - Perhaps there should be an image for each category?

o Handle formatted info.txt content better (e.g. Cormac's comments)

o Provide hierarchical listing page of every object, in same order as shown in Overlay Editor.  We'll need a new data stucture for this, reflecting the virtual path structure.  

o Mark whether an object has a lit texture

o 3D renderer for x-plane .obj files
