#tag ModuleProtected Module ZipConfig	#tag Note, Name = Documentation				In this module you find a few configuration constants		that are used for conditional compiling.				HaveEinhugurPlugin		------------------				  Default: true				  Set this to "false" if you do not have the e-CryptIt plugin installed.				    You can then still use these classes to create Zip		    archives, but the items in them will not be compressed		    but rather stored in their original size.		    Make sure that you have the items from the folder		    "AddWhenNotUsingEinhugurPlugin" added to your project.				DefaultToUnicode		----------------				  Default: true				  Originally, names in a Zip archive were encoded with the old DOS character set,		  or in special double byte codes in non-roman environments. If you want to		  create or read Zip archives always in that naming convention, set this to "false".				  Nowadays, however, Unicode (UTF-8) is used on OS X to store file names in a		  Zip archive. Windows (XP) still prefers not to use Unicode, though - so you might		  want to set this to false if you primarily work with Windows files in archives.				  This defines only the default, however. You may still pass a specific encoding		  when opening a Zip archive.				EnableZipIt2_2_2_UnicodeSupport		-----------------------------				  Default: true				  When enabled, the lowest bit of the "external permissions" field in the central directory		  is set to 1 upon creating a new entry with a UTF-8 encoded file name. This allows		  ZipIt 2.2.2 to detect the unicode encoding.				  Set this option to false if you do not want the "external permissions" field be		  messed with this way. (It does not seem to have an effect on Apple's Zip tool in		  OS X 10.4, but maybe other tools you might want to support do not like this.)				EmulateOSXRenaming		-------------------				  Default: false				  Defines how to rename illegal file name characters such as "/", "\" and ":".				  When set to false, the default DOS and ZipIt rules are applied:		    When adding an item to an archive, any "/" and "\" in a file name is replaced with "-";		    When reading from an archive, any ":" is replaced by "-".				  When set to true, the OS X (10.4) Zip tool rules are applied:		    When adding an item to an archive, any "/" in a file name is replaced with ":";		    When reading from an archive and running on Mac OS, any ":" is replaced by "/".		    When reading from an archive and running not on Mac OS, any ":" is replaced by "-".				AvoidFSSpecCalls		---------------				  This is meant to avoid the old-style (soon deprecated) FSSpec-based File Manager calls		  under Mac OS X, and instead use the modern FSRef-based calls. The code for this		  is not implemented yet, though, which means you must not set this option to true.			#tag EndNote	#tag Constant, Name = HaveEinhugurPlugin, Type = Boolean, Dynamic = False, Default = \"true", Scope = Public	#tag EndConstant	#tag Constant, Name = CarbonLibName, Type = String, Dynamic = False, Default = \"", Scope = Public		#Tag Instance, Platform = Mac Carbon PEF, Language = Default, Definition  = \"CarbonLib"		#Tag Instance, Platform = Any, Language = Default, Definition  = \"Carbon"	#tag EndConstant	#tag Constant, Name = UseTTsOldPlugins, Type = Boolean, Dynamic = False, Default = \"false", Scope = Public	#tag EndConstant	#tag Constant, Name = AvoidFSSpecCalls, Type = Boolean, Dynamic = False, Default = \"false", Scope = Public	#tag EndConstant	#tag Constant, Name = DefaultToUnicode, Type = Boolean, Dynamic = False, Default = \"true", Scope = Public	#tag EndConstant	#tag Constant, Name = EmulateOSXRenaming, Type = Boolean, Dynamic = False, Default = \"false", Scope = Public	#tag EndConstant	#tag Constant, Name = EnableZipIt2_2_2_UnicodeSupport, Type = Boolean, Dynamic = False, Default = \"true", Scope = Public	#tag EndConstant	#tag ViewBehavior		#tag ViewProperty			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InitialValue="-2147483648"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty	#tag EndViewBehaviorEnd Module#tag EndModule
