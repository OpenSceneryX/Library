	<p>The OpenSceneryX project is a library of scenery objects for <a href='http://www.x-plane.com' target='_blank'>X-Plane&reg; v8.50 and above</a>. It is a collaborative effort by members of the <a href='http://www.x-plane.org' target='_blank'>X-Plane.org</a> community and the aim is to provide a good range of high quality scenery components for authors to use in their scenery packages.</p>
	
	<p>An index of all the objects in the current version is available down the right hand side of this page. Roll over them to see a screenshot of each object and click to view some more information about the object. Note that you cannot download single objects, you must download the library as a whole.</p>

	<h2>Download</h2>
	
	<h3>Recommended Option: Installer</h3>
	<p>Click one of the following links to download the OpenSceneryX installer:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.opensceneryx.com/downloads/OpenSceneryX%20Installer%20Mac.app.zip">Mac Installer</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.opensceneryx.com/downloads/OpenSceneryX%20Installer%20Windows.zip">Windows Installer</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.opensceneryx.com/downloads/OpenSceneryX%20Installer%20Linux.tar.gz">Linux Installer</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please note that the Linux version <b>requires GTK+ 2.x</b>.</p>
	
	<h3>Alternative Option: Zip File</h3>

	<p>If for any reason you cannot use the installer, for example if you are behind a restrictive firewall or if you need to download on one machine and install on another, then you can	download a zip file containing the whole library by clicking the following link: <a href="http://www.opensceneryx.com/downloads/OpenSceneryX.zip">OpenSceneryx.zip</a>. <strong>PLEASE ONLY USE THIS OPTION IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO</strong> because it is hard on my bandwidth and also much slower because you have to download the entire library rather than just the files that have changed.
	
	<h2>Installation</h2>
	
	<h3>Installer</h3>
	<p>If you used the recommended option and downloaded the installer, just unzip it and run it. You will be asked to locate your X-Plane&reg; folder and then the installer will automatically download the latest version of OpenSceneryX.</p>
	<p>You don't need to download a new installer every time you want to update OpenSceneryX, you can just re-run the installer whenever you like and it will only download files that have changed.</p>
	
	<h3>Zip File</h3>
	<p>If you downloaded the full zipped version, unzip it and a folder titled 'OpenSceneryX' should be created. Move this folder into the 'Custom Scenery' folder inside your X-Plane folder</p>
	
	<h2>Use</h2>
	<h3>Normal X-Plane&reg; Users</h3>
	<p>If you are a standard user of X-Plane&reg;, then you don't do anything else. Installing this library does nothing <strong>on it's own</strong> to the simulator - you won't see new objects dotted about, you won't see any changes to your default scenery, you won't see any new options in X-Plane&reg;. However, scenery packages developed by other people can now use the objects in this library, so if you have installed any scenery package marked 'Enhanced by OpenSceneryX' then that package will come alive with objects.</p>
	
	<h3>X-Plane&reg; Scenery Developers</h3>
	<p>If you are a scenery developer, click the following link to download the OpenSceneryX Developer Pack: <a href='http://www.opensceneryx.com/downloads/OpenSceneryX-DeveloperPack-${version}.zip'>OpenSceneryX Developer Pack ${version}</a>. Instructions for use are enclosed. If you have used OpenSceneryX in your scenery package, let us know by <a href='http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?act=Msg&CODE=4&MID=2431' target='_blank'>contacting me at x-plane.org</a>.</p>

	<h3>Would you like to contribute?</h3>
	<p>At the moment we especially need airport objects - vehicles and other paraphernalia for authors to populate their airports with, but providing it's good quality we will take anything. So, if you would like to contribute some of your own objects to the library, please <a href='http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?act=Msg&CODE=4&MID=2431' target='_blank'>send a Personal Message to me at x-plane.org</a> letting me know what you've got.</p>
