	<p>The OpenSceneryX project is a library of scenery objects for <a href='https://www.x-plane.com' onclick='window.open(this.href);return false;'>X-Plane&reg;</a> 8.6 and above. X-Plane X-Plane&reg; 9, 10 and 11 are fully supported. It is a collaborative effort by members of the <a href='http://www.x-plane.org' onclick='window.open(this.href);return false;'>X-Plane.org</a> community and the aim is to provide a good range of high quality scenery components for scenery authors to use in their scenery packages.</p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>If you're reading this, you have successfully installed OpenSceneryX. To periodically check for new versions, just re-run the installer and follow the instructions. It will automatically update your OpenSceneryX installation for you.</p>

	<h2>Documentation</h2>
	<p>Documentation for every object in the library is found on the <a href='https://www.opensceneryx.com' onclick='window.open(this.href);return false;'>OpenSceneryX website</a>.</p>

	<h2>Use</h2>

	<h3>Normal X-Plane&reg; Users</h3>
	<p>If you are a standard user of X-Plane&reg;, then you don't do anything else. Installing this library does nothing <strong>on it's own</strong> to the simulator - you won't see new objects dotted about, you won't see any changes to your default scenery, you won't see any new options in X-Plane&reg;. However, scenery packages developed by other people can now use the objects in this library, so if you have installed any scenery package marked 'Enhanced by OpenSceneryX' then that package will come alive with objects.</p>

	<h3>X-Plane&reg; Scenery Developers</h3>
	<p>If you are a scenery developer, go to the <a href='https://www.opensceneryx.com' onclick='window.open(this.href);return false;'>OpenSceneryX website</a>, download the Developer Pack and read the enclosed instructions.</p>

	<h3>Would you like to contribute?</h3>
	<p>At the moment we especially need airport objects - vehicles and other paraphernalia for authors to populate their airports with, but providing it's good quality we will take anything. So, if you would like to contribute some of your own objects to the library, please <a href='https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/messenger/compose/&to=2431' onclick='window.open(this.href);return false;'>send a Personal Message to me at x-plane.org</a> letting me know what you've got.</p>
