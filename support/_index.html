  <p>The OpenSceneryX project is a library of scenery objects for X-Plane v8.50 and above.  It is a collaborative effort by members of the <a href='http://www.x-plane.org'>X-Plane.org</a> community and the aim is to provide a good range of high quality scenery components for scenery authors to use in their scenery packages.</p>

  <p>An index of all the objects in the current version is available down the right hand side of this page.  Roll over them to see a screenshot of each object and click to view some more information about the object.</p>
  
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>If you're reading this you have already downloaded and run the installer, and you have successfully installed OpenSceneryX.  To periodically check for new versions of OpenSceneryX, just re-run the installer and follow the instructions.  It will automatically update your OpenSceneryX installation for you.
  
  <h2>Use</h2>
  
  <h3>Normal X-Plane Users</h3>
  <p>If you are a standard user of X-Plane, then you don't do anything else. Installing this library does nothing <strong>on it's own</strong> to the simulator - you won't see new objects dotted about, you won't see any changes to your default scenery, you won't see any new options in X-Plane.  However, scenery packages developed by other people can now use the objects in this library, so if you have installed any scenery package marked 'Enhanced by OpenSceneryX' then that package will come alive with objects.</p>
  
  <h3>X-Plane Scenery Developers</h3>
  <p>If you are a scenery developer, ensure you have installed OpenSceneryX and then go to the <a href='http://www.opensceneryx.com'>OpenSceneryX website</a>, download the Developer Pack and read the enclosed instructions.</p>
