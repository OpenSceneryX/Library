  <p>The OpenSceneryX project is a library of scenery objects for X-Plane v8.50 and above.  It is a collaborative effort by members of the <a href='http://www.x-plane.org'>X-Plane.org</a> community and the aim is to provide a good range of scenery components for authors to use in their scenery packages.</p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>If you're reading this you have already completed the first step by unzipping the package. You will have a folder titled <tt>OpenSceneryX-${version}</tt> in which you found this ReadMe file.  Now do the following:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Locate your X-Plane folder on your hard disk.  In Windows, this is likely to be <tt>C:\Program Files\X-Plane</tt> or <tt>C:\Program Files\X-System</tt> or similar. On the Mac, it is likely to be <tt>X-Plane</tt> or <tt>X-System</tt> in your <tt>Applications</tt> folder. Note that the X-Plane folder may have the version appended (e.g. <tt>X-Plane 8.50</tt>).</li>
    <li>Open the <tt>Custom Scenery</tt> folder inside your <tt>X-Plane</tt> folder.</li>
    <li>Copy the <tt>OpenSceneryX-${version}</tt> folder into the <tt>Custom Scenery</tt> folder.</li>
    <li>If you have installed OpenSceneryX before, please delete the old folder - It is definitely not advisable to keep more than one version of OpenSceneryX installed.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Use</h2>
  
  <h3>Normal X-Plane Users</h3>
  <p>If you are a standard user of X-Plane, then you don't do anything else. Installing this library does nothing <strong>on it's own</strong> to the simulator - you won't see new objects dotted about, you won't see any changes to your default scenery, you won't see any new options in X-Plane.  However, scenery packages developed by other people can now use the objects in this library, so if you have installed any scenery package marked 'Requires OpenSceneryX' then that package will come alive with objects.</p>
  
  <h3>X-Plane Scenery Developers</h3>
  <p>If you are a scenery developer, firstly follow the installation instructions above then <a href='http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?autocom=dlmanager&do=viewfile&fid=7561'>download the OpenSceneryX Developer Pack</a> and read the enclosed enstructions.</p>

  <h2>Contributors</h2>
  <p>A big thank you to the following people who have contributed to the library: ${authors}. If you would like to contribute some of your own objects to the library, <a href='http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?showuser=2431'>contact me at the .org</a></p>
