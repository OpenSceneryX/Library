<h2>OpenSceneryX Release Notes</h2>

<h3>Version 1.3.0 xxx xxx 2007</h3>
<ul>
<li>This version contains some modifications to static aircraft in the library to ensure they all have consistent origins and orientation: Some aircraft had a heading of 0 degrees, some had a heading of 270 degrees, all are now consistently 0 degrees; Some aircraft had their origin at their centre of gravity, some at the tip of the nose and some in arbitrary places, all now have their origins set to the tip of the nose.  Orientation changes were made to the following aircraft:
  <ul>
    <li>B727-200 American, Delta and United</li>
    <li>B747-400 British Airways</li>
    <li>B737-548 Aer Lingus.com</li>
    <li>B757-200 Air 2000, Airtours and American</li>
    <li>MD90-50 American</li>
  </ul>
origin changes were made to the following aircraft:
  <ul>
    <li>B747-400 British Airways</li>
    <li>B747-400 Eva Air</li>
    <li>B757-300 Northwest and Northwest historical livery</li>
    <li>Embraer-170 House</li>
    <li>C172SP</li>
    <li>C180J All variants</li>
    <li>C185E All variants</li>
    <li>PA18 All variants</li>
  </ul>
If you have already used any of these aircraft in a scenery package, please check the positioning as it will have changed.  I apologise for this, but going forward we should use a consistent orientation and origin scheme and it is best to get it right now.</li>

  </ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.2.1 5th May 2007</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix for missing textures on some objects (all obj v7 objects had a problem, as did some objects that should have been excluded from the library).  This affected the American Airlines MD-50 and the Embraer 170s.</li>
<li>Most aircraft are now published to many more virtual paths to allow for lots of choices for randomisation of aircraft.  A few examples: All heavy jets are now published to <tt>objects/aircraft/jets/heavy.obj</tt> to allow the selection of a random heavy from all heavy jets; all jets are now published to <tt>objects/aircraft/jets.obj</tt> to allow the selection of a random jet from all jets; all aircraft are now published to <tt>objects/aircraft.obj</tt> to allow the selection of a random aircraft from all aircraft in the library.  Some special purpose aircraft (skiplanes, floatplanes) and liveries (historical, manufacturer house colours) are excluded from this.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.2.0 4th May 2007</h3>
<ul>
<li>From this version onwards, the library is now distributed using an installer.  The installer only downloads new or modified files, so reducing the size and time taken.</li>
<li>Animated objects are now marked with an icon in the documentation</li>
<li>Where multiple liveries are available for an aircraft, all appropriate liveries are all now published to the same generic virtual path as well as the livery-specific path.  This allows authors to pick a generic aircraft and X-Plane&reg; will automatically randomise between the available liveries.  Some liveries are not included in this - one-offs, house colours and historical colours.</li>
