<h2>OpenSceneryX Release Notes for Latest Version</h2>

<h3>Version 4.0.0 4th March 2019</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>Incorporated <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/49646-dt-library/"><em>DT Library</em></a> by <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/613332-tbolt47/">Darrell Thompson</a> into OpenSceneryX, which includes a large set of markings suitable for small to medium airports.</li>
			<li><a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/389608-einstein/">einstein</a> has contributed seasonal variants (autumn and winter without snow) for the original OpenSceneryX tree forests. This enables autumn and winter (without snow) for any sceneries that use originl OpenSceneryX forests, as well as most of the individual plant and tree objects.</li>
			<li><a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/499928-madmaxland/">madmaxland</a> has contributed a spring seasonal variant for the original OpenSceneryX tree forests. This enables springtime for any sceneries that use original OpenSceneryX forests, as well as most of the individual plant and tree objects.</li>
			<li>FlyAgi has contributed seasonal variants (autumn, winter mild and winter deep) for all his vegetation forests.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modified scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>The runway closed 'X' marking has been replaced by an improved version from DT Library which includes normals.</li>
			<li>Some aircraft, both jets and props, are now incorporated into the X-Plane® static aircraft system.</li>
			<li>Fixed missing <tt>TEXTURE_NORMAL</tt> in oil fired power station.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Other changes:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Major new feature</strong>: Support for seasons. OpenSceneryX now exports seasonal regions compatible with core X-Plane, the <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/44351-four-seasons/">Four Seasons plugin</a>, the <a href="http://maxx-xp.com/terramaxx">TerraMaxx plugin</a> and the <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/168048-xambience-arrives/">xAmbience plugin</a>. Seasonal support is optional and can be chosen on install. Note that we only support seasons for library contributions that have seasonal alternatives.</li>
			<li><strong>Major new feature</strong>: Support for injecting OpenSceneryX items into X-Plane® built-in libraries. This can be used to enhance the X-Plane® automatic object placement and autogen. This is optional and can be selected on install. Currently some of the OpenSceneryX aircraft are exported to be used for static aircraft around airports.</li>
			<li>Updated the <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/25033-backup-scenery-library/">Backup Library</a> to v2.2.0</li>
			<li>The library still includes the <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/25033-backup-scenery-library/">Backup Library</a> but it is now separate and the installer gives the choice of using or not using it.</li>
			<li>The website now provides more information about <tt>line</tt>s in the library - layer group, layer offset, line width and whether the line is mirrored.</li>
			<li>The website now provides more information about <tt>object</tt>s in the library - whether they have multiple LODs, custom lights, named lights, parameterised lights, spill lighting, whether the object tilts on uneven ground and whether it emits black or white smoke. Also, objects are marked as 'animated' automatically now, by directly examining the .obj file for animation commands.</li>
			<li>Markdown is now supported for all descriptions of items. This is automatically converted to HTML for publishing on the website. Many descriptions that were being squashed down to a single paragraph have been rewritten using Markdown and tables, e.g. many of the polygons, making them far more readable.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 3.2.0 6th January 2019</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>Incorporated <a href="https://flyagi.de/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=11"><em>FlyAgi Wind Turbine Library</em></a> by <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/543995-flyagi/">FlyAgi</a> into OpenSceneryX, which includes 40 animated wind turbines in a variety of heights and styles.</li>
			<li>Incorporated <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/48047-flyagi-vegetation/"><em>FlyAgi Vegetation Library</em></a> by <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/543995-flyagi/">FlyAgi</a> into OpenSceneryX, including:
				<ul>
					<li>A set of 'forests' of volumentric grass, in a variety of shades.</li>
					<li>A set of 'forests' of volumetric flowers, vines and shrubs.</li>
					<li>A large set of 265 higher definition forests.</li>
					<li>An additional Acer (Maple) tree, in a variety of heights, using the same high definition texture as the new forests.</li>
					<li>An additional two Quercus (Oak) trees, in a variety of heights, using the same high definition texture as the new forests.</li>
					<li>A Corylus (Hazel) tree, in a variety of heights, using the same high definition texture as the new forests.</li>
				</ul>
				Thank you Agi for offering this merge, it is really appreciated.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modified scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>Some aircraft, both jets and props, are now incorporated into the X-Plane® static aircraft system.</li>
			<li>The USA Hawaiian forests were empty and using a blank texture, which has been the case since they were first added. We now use <tt>pacific_lowland</tt> instead, as the closest match.</li>
			<li>Added <tt>TILTED</tt> attribute to all appropriate objects so they follow sloped terrain. Affects aircraft, vehicles, some furniture and some people.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Other changes:
		<ul>
			<li>Removed all unnecessary <tt>EXPORT_BACKUP</tt> lines for <em>RE_Library</em> backup library.</li>
			<li>Third party libraries are now exported using <tt>EXPORT_BACKUP</tt> instead of <tt>DEPRECATED</tt> <tt>EXPORT</tt> entries. Means that if both OpenSceneryX and the source library are installed, the source library takes precedence, which is important when it is still being actively maintained and updated and may be ahead of OpenSceneryX.</li>
			<li>Replaced the Backup Library with the latest v2.0.0 version.</li>
			<li>We now export all appropriate aircraft into the X-Plane® static aircraft system as <tt>EXPORT_EXTEND</tt> entries. Means that X-Plane® will now automatically incorporate OpenSceneryX aircraft when populating static aircraft on the ground. Thank you to triplemon, xibo and Galileu for their assistance with this.</li>
			<li>Individual screenshots generated for all European forests.</li>
			<li>Individual screenshots generated for all US forests.</li>
			<li>Added a set of simHeaven export paths so they don't have to copy actual objects out of OpenSceneryX on installation of their packages. These new paths will be used in the next releases of VFR Landmarks and X-Europe.</li>
			<li>Now write a <tt>version.txt</tt> file containing the version number and date into the library folder, for utilities such as xOrganiser to use.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 3.1.0 20th November 2018</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>A huge collection of 1263 individual plants and trees, built using the same textures as the existing forests for efficiency. As objects, these are much more convenient to use than forests if you need to place individual plants.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modified scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>Updated DDS version of European tree texture to include two missing trees.</li>
			<li>Added DDS versions of US tree textures.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Other changes:
		<ul>
			<li>Added 15 missing or incorrect paths from <em>RE_Library</em>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 3.0.0 18th October 2018</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>Incorporated most of <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/24722-re_library-airport-buildings-and-related-objects/"><em>RE_Library</em></a> by Richard C Elliott (<a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/389608-einstein/">einstein at the .org</a>) into OpenSceneryX, which is about 900 objects. There are too many to list individually here, but the collection includes offices, radio installations, vehicles, hangars, fire stations, control towers, terminals and visual control rooms. Thank you Richard for offering this merge, it is hugely appreciated and expands the scope of OpenSceneryX considerably.
				<ul>
					<li><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE 1</strong>: Certain iconic objects from specific airports were <u>not included</u> because OpenSceneryX, by design, does not contain world-unique objects (for example, the old EGCC Manchester International control tower). If any designer has used these objects, they will disappear. To fix this, airport designers will need to include these objects directly in their scenery packages. Richard has given permission to use his objects directly in this way (see the documentation in the <em>RE_Library</em> package) but as a courtesy it might be polite to drop him a note to let him know.</li>
					<li><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE 2</strong>: Some objects that were very similar to others were merged, for efficiency.</li>
					<li><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE 3</strong>: Because OSX requires all vehicles to be facing North with the tip of the nose at the origin, The <em>RE_Library</em> fire engines will change position and orientation. I'm afraid the only way to sort this out is for airport designers to tweak the placements of these objects and release new versions of their airports.</li>
					<li><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE 4</strong>: Some of the control tower objects in <em>RE_Library</em> were combinations of specific office blocks and specific Visual Control Rooms (VCRs). For efficiency, these have been replaced with the equivalent office blocks (without VCR), so airports that have used these will need to be modified to have a VCR placed on top of the office block. However, this has the added advantage that many more building / VCR combinations are now possible.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Four Supacat SUV600 fire vehicles, based on Land Rover 6x6 chassis.</li>
			<li>A set of fire training rigs in a variety of colours.</li>

			<li>A 250m radio mast and a 30m radio tower.</li>
			<li>Three small metal huts.</li>

		</ul>
	</li>

		<ul>
			<li>All legacy X-Plane® v7 objects have been converted to v8. The only objects affected were the animals.</li>
			<li>Fishing boats 1, 2, 3 and 4 were not pointing North. These have been rotated 90 degrees to conform with the OpenSceneryX standard. Apologies for any problems this may cause with existing scenery packs.</li>
			<li>None of the Robin DR221 aircraft were pointing North. These have been rotated 90 degrees to conform with the OpenSceneryX standard. Apologies for any problems this may cause with existing scenery packs.</li>
			<li>The small yellow, white and red/white cones have been replaced with improved models.</li>
			<li>The existing 12m shipping container was rotated 90 degrees to standardise across all shipping containers. Apologies for any problems this may cause with existing scenery packs.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Two invalid lines were fixed in the backup libraries (<em>RE_Library</em> and <em>world2xplane library</em>).</li>
			<li>Added support to include external libraries within OpenSceneryX, which provides the ability for libraries to be merged. Items in external libraries are published to their original paths as well as new OpenSceneryX paths.</li>

			<li>Refreshed design and branding in library docs and developer pack docs.</li>
			<li>All processing for legacy X-Plane® v7 format object files has been removed. The v7 format is no longer supported by OpenSceneryX.</li>
			<li>Re-compressed a bunch of the PNG textures that gave the best saving in file size.</li>
			<li>Developer documentation PDF now contains clickable screenshots and titles to take you to the online docs for the item.</li>
			<li>Website now shows a carousel of the latest additions to the library, with screenshots and links.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 2.2.0 29th July 2018</h3>
<ul>
	<li>No new scenery objects in this version</li>
	<li>No modified scenery objects in this version</li>
	<li>Other changes:
		<ul>
			<li>The library now includes the excellent <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/25033-backup-scenery-library/"><em>backup library</em></a> originally by <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/45106-chris-k/">chris k</a> and now maintained by <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/389608-einstein/">einstein</a>, to help reduce problems with missing scenery packages. The installer has a setting to show visible or invisible placeholders - visible if you want to see that you are missing some libraries, invisible if you prefer not to know.</li>
			<li>The installer now supports the default Steam X-Plane® folder on Mac (which is normally beneath the invisible 'Library' folder). Click the 'Use Steam' button to set your X-Plane® path to this, if the folder exists.</li>
			<li>The placeholder library (for developers to include in their scenery packages) is now marked as PRIVATE so that scenery editing programs don't show the contents.</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

			<li>Previous versions published a floodlight at <tt>objects/furniture/lights/flood</tt>, but this was inadvertantly removed in 2.0.0. This has been fixed.</li>
			<li>More information is provided about each polygon in the docs: The horizontal and vertical texture scale, the layer group name, the layer offset and the surface type.</li>
			<li>Moved the lines in <tt>lines/airport/zone_boundaries</tt> to a more general <tt>lines/solid_lines</tt> folder. They are still published to the old path too, for backward compatibility.</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modified scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>A complete audit of all objects has been done for X-Plane® 10 compaitibility. This involved removing all ground shadows, either by removing the shadow from the texture or removing the ground plane from the model. Also, all objects with unnecessary lit textures (i.e. those that don't have internal illumination) have had those lit textures removed. A future change will be to remove all lit textures from the entire library, as all illumination should be modelled in future using real lights.</li>
			<li>Fixed z-buffer thrashing (flickering) on shadows on most of the vans.</li>
			<li>Fixed error with incorrectly named light on the ASR11 radar object.</li>
			<li>Fixed problem with the texture on the spherical water tower.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>Developer pack now contains a large PDF reference book, containing everything in the library with screenshots.</li>

			<li>Content of website homepage is now above the table of contents.</li>
			<li>Now automatically build sitemap.xml file for website SEO.</li>
			<li>Fixed some XHTML (strict) validation errors on website.</li>
			<li>Removed the info.txt files from the distribution - the authors names are still listed in the readme file. For this version, this reduces the number of files by 2087 and size by 8.6Mb.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug in placeholder library - the placeholder for polygons was set to be a .lin file, causing X-Plane® to fall over if the placeholder library is used and OpenSceneryX is not installed.</li>
			<li>Fixed another bug in placeholder library - neither the line or polygon placeholders were working because the contents of minimal <tt>.lin</tt> and <tt></tt>.pol files need a bit more defined than for the other scenery object types.</li>
			<li>Floodlights are now published to both <tt>airport/furniture/lights/flood</tt> and <tt>furniture/lights/flood</tt></li>
			<li>Added sub-categories to airport vehicles in the docs.</li>
			<li>Added breadcrumbs to release notes page.</li>

			<li>Added 'skip to content' links on all documentation pages.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.8.0 9th May 2008</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>A set of wooden houses.</li>
			<li>A TESLA radar installation.</li>
			<li>Three A320s in Frontier Cougar, Fox and Ram liveries</li>
			<li>A B737-800 in Aeromexico livery</li>
			<li>A DC-3</li>
			<li>A forklift truck</li>
			<li>A large selection of military aircraft, both vintage and non-vintage</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modified scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>Modified the texture for the fences, changing it from an indexed-colour PNG to an RGB PNG and adding an alpha channel corresponding to the background colour. Some users were having issues with this texture displaying badly.</li>
			<li>Modified the small airport containers, they were partly underground.</li>
			<li>Fixed the LearJet 60 to correct its orientation</li>
			<li>Scaled down the texture size on the container and railings</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Other changes:
		<ul>
			<li>The full documentation, individual object screenshots and the windsock tutorial are no longer included in the downloaded library, these are now only available on the OpenSceneryX website. This reduces the uncompressed library size by 22Mb, but more importantly reduces the number of files in the library by 2086, which has a noticeable effect on the overall time it takes to download, even though most of these are individually small files.</li>
			<li>The documentation for each object now contains a list of all other objects that share a texture with it. This is useful for careful selection of objects to improve frame-rates. Thanks go to amerrir for this suggestion.</li>
			<li>Re-structured the buildings and structures section of the documentation, because we're getting quite a few objects here now</li>
			<li>Re-structured the aircraft section of the documentation, because we're getting quite a few objects here now too</li>
			<li>The web documentation now includes a Google search box for searching the site</li>
			<li>The web documentation now has discreet Google sponsored links, to help pay for the web server and future source code server.<br />
				<small>[<strong>Note from the maintainer:</strong> <em>Please don't shout at me for this, I categorically state that the library will never in any way be commercial, I just need some financial help with the hosting.</em>]</small></li>
			<li>The version number is now included at the top of the library files.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.7.0 2nd March 2008</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>Falcon has contributed 19 new liveries for Bertrand Augras' aircraft. This means there are 321 new aircraft variants in the library - a huge increase. The new liveries are: Aer Lingus, Air Berlin, Air Malta, China Eastern, DHL, easyJet, El Al Israel, FedEx, Germanwings, Lauda Air, LTU, Meridiana, PrivatAir, SAS, Singapore, SunExpress, TNT, TUIfly and UPS. Note that just two of this new set (B747-400 El Al Israel and B747-400 Singapore) replace existing objects.</li>
			<li>A pair of cooling towers.</li>
			<li>A trio of gasometers.</li>
			<li>A power station.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modified scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>

			<li>The small tug 1 has been modified so half the object is no longer invisible.</li>
			<li>The medium sized truck has been modified so half the object is no longer invisible.</li>
			<li>The fuel tanker has been modified so half the object is no longer invisible. Additionally, this object has had it's origin changed so that it is at the front of the object like other vehicles.</li>
			<li>The large tugs 2, 3 and 4 had texture transparency problems, these have been fixed.</li>
			<li>The military tug had texture transparency problems, this has been fixed.</li>
			<li>The transit van has been modified so half the object is no longer invisible.</li>
			<li>The lift has been modified so half the object is no longer invisible.</li>
			<li>The wooden control tower has been scaled down, it was far too large</li>
			<li>Spent a lot of time editing windmill 2 - removed unused polygons, fixed textures, simplified model, scaled it down a bit, changed orientation. Unfortunately the animation was inadvertently removed from the vanes, it would be great if a volunteer would like to re-animate it...</li>
			<li>Scaled windmill 1 down a little.</li>
			<li>Scaled the wooden hangar down a lot.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.6.0 12th February 2008</h3>
<ul>

			<li>The remainder of Bertrand's GA aircraft have been added: Jodel D112, Robin DR221, Robin DR400, Robin HR200, Morane-Saulnier MS-880 Rallye, Robin R3000 and Socata TB20. These are each available in 16 paints and use his clever texture sharing method across all aircraft.</li>
			<li>A collection of hangars.</li>
			<li>A dutch windmill.</li>
			<li>A wooden control tower.</li>
			<li>A powerboat forest.</li>
			<li>A wooden clubhouse building.</li>

			<li>A collection of three gliders.</li>
			<li>Open and closed versions of the chain link fence have been added to allow fences with holes</li>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modified scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>The Singapore B747-400 has been replaced with a higher quality version with a shadow.</li>
			<li>The Art Deco hangar has had its origin changed so that it is in the centre of the object.</li>
			<li>Fixed a problem with the shadow on the fuel truck.</li>
			<li>Fixed the shadow on the Ford Mustang (and updated .obj to v8 format)</li>
			<li>Fixed the vanes on windmill 1 (removed solid areas of white)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Other changes:
		<ul>

		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.5.1 19th January 2008</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>Bertrand Augras has been hard at work again, this time producing a set of GA aircraft. The aircraft added so far are: Cessna 150, Cessna 172. These are each available in 16 paints and use his clever texture sharing method across all aircraft.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Modified scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>The conical red and white water tower has been scaled down - it was far too large.</li>
			<li>The modern control tower has been scaled up - it was far too small.</li>
			<li>The Ford Mustang, conical water tower and wind turbine have all had their textures re-saved without interlacing to avoid complaints from OverlayEditor.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Other changes:
		<ul>
			<li>Corrected the copyright notices for all B737-800s to show Benedikt as the author and (where appropriate) the correct texture author. Apologies to all concerned for the incorrect accreditation on these aircraft.</li>
			<li>The version number and release date are now inserted into the documentation using JavaScript. This avoids the entire documentation set changing every time a new version of the library is released (therefore giving smaller updates).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.5.0 30th November 2007</h3>
<ul>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>The fabulous EDDM collection of static aircraft (produced by Jochen Haink from the original XPFP aircraft) has been added. OpenSceneryX doesn't quite contain the full collection of EDDM aircraft because some duplicate Bertrand Augras' aircraft and liveries, even so this is another huge addition of high quality models. Aircraft types are: A320, A340, B727, B737, B747, B767 and B777 all in various liveries.</li>
			<li>King Air B200</li>
			<li>53' Shipping container</li>
			<li>A portable barrier</li>
			<li>A fuel truck</li>
			<li>Bertrand Augras has developed a number of new liveries for his collection of aircraft and these have all been added to the library. The new liveries apply to all 17 of his aircraft and are: Cathay Pacific, Croatia Airlines, Iberia, Jalways, Qantas, United</li>
			<li>Ket has contributed a number of farm animals to the library.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Updated scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>All of Bertrand's aircraft have been updated to his latest versions, improving the aircraft models, textures and fixing some issues.</li>
			<li>All alpilotx's forests have been updated from his v1.0 files to his v2.1 files. See <a href="http://www.alpilotx.de" onclick='window.open(this.href);return false;'>his site</a> for details of the changes. This update fixes the error that X-Plane® 8.61 and above shows when launching with OpenSceneryX installed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.4.0 3rd September 2007</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Complete re-vamp of documentation system, the index was becoming confusing and unuseable: Objects are now categorised (note that this is purely for the documentation, it doesn't affect the use of the library in X-Plane®). The display is much more compact and is now tabbed to reduce screen space used. Objects with multiple variants (e.g. aircraft with several liveries) now each have their own page showing the variants. For objects with multiple variants, only a single entry is shown in the table of contents now, further reducing the size of the list.</li>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>A huge collection of high-quality aircraft contributed by Bertrand Augras, 17 aircraft types in 11 liveries. The types are: A310, A320, A340, A380, ATR42, B737, B747, B757, Beech B1900, Dornier D328, Embaer EMB120, Embraer ERJ145, Fokker 50, MD11, MD90, BAE RJ70, Saab 340. The liveries are: Aeroflot, Aerolineas Argentinas, Air Canada, Air France, Alitalia, British Airways, Emirates, JAL, KLM, Lufthansa and Swiss. Bertrand has very cleverly shared a single texture (per livery) across all his aircraft, so reducing the load on the graphics card for these aircraft.</li>
			<li>LearJet 60</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.3.0 29th May 2007</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This version contains some modifications to static aircraft in the library to ensure they all have consistent origins and orientation: Some aircraft had a heading of 0 degrees, some had a heading of 270 degrees, all are now consistently 0 degrees; Some aircraft had their origin at their centre of gravity, some at the tip of the nose and some in arbitrary places, all now have their origins set to the tip of the nose. Orientation changes were made to the following aircraft:
		<ul>
			<li>B727-200 American, Delta and United</li>
			<li>B747-400 British Airways</li>
			<li>B737-548 Aer Lingus.com</li>
			<li>B757-200 Air 2000, Airtours and American</li>
			<li>MD90-50 American</li>
		</ul>
		origin changes were made to the following aircraft:
		<ul>
			<li>B747-400 British Airways</li>
			<li>B747-400 Eva Air</li>
			<li>B757-300 Northwest and Northwest historical livery</li>
			<li>Embraer-170 House</li>
			<li>C172SP</li>
			<li>C180J All variants</li>
			<li>C185E All variants</li>
			<li>PA18 All variants</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: If you have already used any of these aircraft in a scenery package, please check the positioning as it will have changed. I apologise for this, but going forward we should use a consistent orientation and origin scheme and it is best to get it right now.</li>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>Small animated radar dish</li>
			<li>Embraer 170 (United livery)</li>
			<li>Embraer 170 (US Airways Express livery)</li>
			<li>Water tower, conical camouflaged</li>
			<li>Water tower, spherical red and white</li>
			<li>Collection of 5 Airbus Belugas</li>
			<li>Art Deco Hangar</li>
			<li>A very large selection of European forests</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Updated scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>The Control Tower has a new model, fixing some transparency problems.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.2.1 5th May 2007</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Bug fix for missing textures on some objects (all obj v7 objects had a problem, as did some objects that should have been excluded from the library). This affected the American Airlines MD-50 and the Embraer 170s.</li>
	<li>Most aircraft are now published to many more virtual paths to allow for lots of choices for randomisation of aircraft. A few examples: All heavy jets are now published to <tt>objects/aircraft/jets/heavy.obj</tt> to allow the selection of a random heavy from all heavy jets; all jets are now published to <tt>objects/aircraft/jets.obj</tt> to allow the selection of a random jet from all jets; all aircraft are now published to <tt>objects/aircraft.obj</tt> to allow the selection of a random aircraft from all aircraft in the library. Some special purpose aircraft (skiplanes, floatplanes) and liveries (historical, manufacturer house colours) are excluded from this.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.2.0 4th May 2007</h3>
<ul>
	<li>From this version onwards, the library is now distributed using an installer. The installer only downloads new or modified files, so reducing the size and time taken.</li>
	<li>Animated objects are now marked with an icon in the documentation</li>
	<li>Where multiple liveries are available for an aircraft, all appropriate liveries are all now published to the same generic virtual path as well as the livery-specific path. This allows authors to pick a generic aircraft and X-Plane® will automatically randomise between the available liveries. Some liveries are not included in this - one-offs, house colours and historical colours.</li>
	<li>New scenery objects in this version:
		<ul>
			<li>B747-400 (Multiple liveries)</li>
			<li>DC-9-10 (Northwest Airlines historical livery 1989-2003)</li>
