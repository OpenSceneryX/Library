<h2>OpenSceneryX Release Notes for Latest Version</h2>

<h3>Version 2.2.0 29th July 2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>No new scenery objects in this version</li>
<li>No modified scenery objects in this version</li>
<li>Other changes:
	<ul>
		<li>The library now includes the excellent backup library by chris k and einstein, to help reduce problems with missing scenery packages.  The installer has a setting to show visible or invisible placeholders - visible if you want to see that you are missing some libraries, invisible if you prefer not to know.</li>
		<li>The installer now supports the default Steam X-Plane folder on Mac (which is normally beneath the invisible 'Library' folder).  Click the 'Use Steam' button to set your X-Plane path to this, if the folder exists.</li>
		<li>The placeholder library (for developers to include in their scenery packages) is now marked as PRIVATE so that scenery editing programs don't show the contents.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>New scenery objects in this version:

	<ul>
		<li>The website has been completely revamped.  The old design of the home page and library contents has gone, and the blog content has been merged in.

</li>
<li>Modified scenery objects in this version:
	<ul>
		<li>A complete audit of all objects has been done for X-Plane® 10 compaitibility. This involved removing all ground shadows, either by removing the shadow from the texture or removing the ground plane from the model.  Also, all objects with unnecessary lit textures (i.e. those that don't have internal illumination) have had those lit textures removed. A future change will be to remove all lit textures from the entire library, as all illumination should be modelled in future using real lights.</li>
		<li>Fixed z-buffer thrashing (flickering) on shadows on most of the vans.</li>
		<li>Fixed error with incorrectly named light on the ASR11 radar object.</li>
		<li>Fixed problem with the texture on the spherical water tower.</li>
		<li>New version of large red fire truck added, removing a hard surface.</li>

	</ul>
</li>
<li>Other changes:
	<ul>
		<li>Developer pack now contains a large PDF reference book, containing everything in the library with screenshots.</li>
		<li>Improved home page of website by adding download icons, extended intro paragraph and added links to all items in the navigation menu.</li>
		<li>Content of website homepage is now above the table of contents.</li>
		<li>Now automatically build sitemap.xml file for website SEO.</li>
		<li>Fixed some XHTML (strict) validation errors on website.</li>
		<li>Removed the info.txt files from the distribution - the authors names are still listed in the readme file.  For this version, this reduces the number of files by 2087 and size by 8.6Mb.</li>
		<li>Fixed bug in placeholder library - the placeholder for polygons was set to be a .lin file, causing X-Plane to fall over if the placeholder library is used and OpenSceneryX is not installed.</li>
		<li>Fixed another bug in placeholder library - neither the line or polygon placeholders were working because the contents of minimal .lin and .pol files need a bit more defined than for the other scenery object types.</li>
		<li>Floodlights are now published to both airport/furniture/lights/flood and furniture/lights/flood</li>
		<li>Added sub-categories to airport vehicles in the docs.</li>
		<li>Added breadcrumbs to release notes page.</li>
		<li>Added share links to all doc pages.</li>

</li>
<li>Modified scenery objects in this version:

		<li>The documentation for each object now contains a list of all other objects that share a texture with it.  This is useful for careful selection of objects to improve frame-rates.  Thanks go to amerrir for this suggestion.</li>

		<li>Re-structured the aircraft section of the documentation, because we're getting quite a few objects here now too</li>

		<li>The web documentation now has discreet Google sponsored links, to help pay for the web server and future source code server.<br/>
		<small>[<strong>Note from the maintainer:</strong> <em>Please don't shout at me for this, I categorically state that the library will never in any way be commercial, I just need some financial help with the hosting.</em>]</small></li>
		<li>The version number is now included at the top of the library files.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

		<li>Scaled windmill 1 down a little.</li>
		<li>Scaled the wooden hangar down a lot.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

		<li>The Ford Mustang, conical water tower and wind turbine have all had their textures re-saved without interlacing to avoid complaints from OverlayEditor.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Other changes:
	<ul>
		<li>Corrected the copyright notices for all B737-800s to show Benedikt as the author and (where appropriate) the correct texture author.  Apologies to all concerned for the incorrect accreditation on these aircraft.</li>
		<li>The version number and release date are now inserted into the documentation using JavaScript.  This avoids the entire documentation set changing every time a new version of the library is released (therefore giving smaller updates).</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.5.0 30th November 2007</h3>
<ul>
<li>New scenery objects in this version:
	<ul>
		<li>The fabulous EDDM collection of static aircraft (produced by Jochen Haink from the original XPFP aircraft) has been added.	OpenSceneryX doesn't quite contain the full collection of EDDM aircraft because some duplicate Bertrand Augras' aircraft and liveries, even so this is another huge addition of high quality models.	Aircraft types are: A320, A340, B727, B737, B747, B767 and B777 all in various liveries.</li>
		<li>King Air B200</li>
		<li>53' Shipping container</li>
		<li>A portable barrier</li>
		<li>A fuel truck</li>
		<li>Bertrand Augras has developed a number of new liveries for his collection of aircraft and these have all been added to the library. The new liveries apply to all 17 of his aircraft and are: Cathay Pacific, Croatia Airlines, Iberia, Jalways, Qantas, United</li>
		<li>Ket has contributed a number of farm animals to the library.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated scenery objects in this version:
	<ul>
		<li>All of Bertrand's aircraft have been updated to his latest versions, improving the aircraft models, textures and fixing some issues.</li>
		<li>All alpilotx's forests have been updated from his v1.0 files to his v2.1 files.	 See <a href="http://www.alpilotx.de" onclick='window.open(this.href);return false;'>his site</a> for details of the changes. This update fixes the error that X-Plane 8.61 and above shows when launching with OpenSceneryX installed.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.4.0 3rd September 2007</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete re-vamp of documentation system, the index was becoming confusing and unuseable:	 Objects are now categorised (note that this is purely for the documentation, it doesn't affect the use of the library in X-Plane).	 The display is much more compact and is now tabbed to reduce screen space used.	Objects with multiple variants (e.g. aircraft with several liveries) now each have their own page showing the variants.	 For objects with multiple variants, only a single entry is shown in the table of contents now, further reducing the size of the list.</li>
<li>New scenery objects in this version:
	<ul>
		<li>A huge collection of high-quality aircraft contributed by Bertrand Augras, 17 aircraft types in 11 liveries.	The types are: A310, A320, A340, A380, ATR42, B737, B747, B757, Beech B1900, Dornier D328, Embaer EMB120, Embraer ERJ145, Fokker 50, MD11, MD90, BAE RJ70, Saab 340.	The liveries are: Aeroflot, Aerolineas Argentinas, Air Canada, Air France, Alitalia, British Airways, Emirates, JAL, KLM, Lufthansa and Swiss.	Bertrand has very cleverly shared a single texture (per livery) across all his aircraft, so reducing the load on the graphics card for these aircraft.</li>
		<li>LearJet 60</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.3.0 29th May 2007</h3>
<ul>
<li>This version contains some modifications to static aircraft in the library to ensure they all have consistent origins and orientation: Some aircraft had a heading of 0 degrees, some had a heading of 270 degrees, all are now consistently 0 degrees; Some aircraft had their origin at their centre of gravity, some at the tip of the nose and some in arbitrary places, all now have their origins set to the tip of the nose.	 Orientation changes were made to the following aircraft:
	<ul>
		<li>B727-200 American, Delta and United</li>
		<li>B747-400 British Airways</li>
		<li>B737-548 Aer Lingus.com</li>
		<li>B757-200 Air 2000, Airtours and American</li>
		<li>MD90-50 American</li>
	</ul>
origin changes were made to the following aircraft:
	<ul>
		<li>B747-400 British Airways</li>
		<li>B747-400 Eva Air</li>
		<li>B757-300 Northwest and Northwest historical livery</li>
		<li>Embraer-170 House</li>
		<li>C172SP</li>
		<li>C180J All variants</li>
		<li>C185E All variants</li>
		<li>PA18 All variants</li>
	</ul>
If you have already used any of these aircraft in a scenery package, please check the positioning as it will have changed.	I apologise for this, but going forward we should use a consistent orientation and origin scheme and it is best to get it right now.</li>
<li>New scenery objects in this version:
	<ul>
		<li>Small animated radar dish</li>
		<li>Embraer 170 (United livery)</li>
		<li>Embraer 170 (US Airways Express livery)</li>
		<li>Water tower, conical camouflaged</li>
		<li>Water tower, spherical red and white</li>
		<li>Collection of 5 Airbus Belugas</li>
		<li>Art Deco Hangar</li>
		<li>A very large selection of European forests</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated scenery objects in this version:
	<ul>
		<li>The Control Tower has a new model, fixing some transparency problems.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Version 1.2.1 5th May 2007</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix for missing textures on some objects (all obj v7 objects had a problem, as did some objects that should have been excluded from the library).	 This affected the American Airlines MD-50 and the Embraer 170s.</li>
<li>Most aircraft are now published to many more virtual paths to allow for lots of choices for randomisation of aircraft.	A few examples: All heavy jets are now published to <tt>objects/aircraft/jets/heavy.obj</tt> to allow the selection of a random heavy from all heavy jets; all jets are now published to <tt>objects/aircraft/jets.obj</tt> to allow the selection of a random jet from all jets; all aircraft are now published to <tt>objects/aircraft.obj</tt> to allow the selection of a random aircraft from all aircraft in the library.	 Some special purpose aircraft (skiplanes, floatplanes) and liveries (historical, manufacturer house colours) are excluded from this.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.2.0 4th May 2007</h3>
<ul>
<li>From this version onwards, the library is now distributed using an installer. The installer only downloads new or modified files, so reducing the size and time taken.</li>
<li>Animated objects are now marked with an icon in the documentation</li>
<li>Where multiple liveries are available for an aircraft, all appropriate liveries are all now published to the same generic virtual path as well as the livery-specific path.	 This allows authors to pick a generic aircraft and X-Plane&reg; will automatically randomise between the available liveries.	 Some liveries are not included in this - one-offs, house colours and historical colours.</li>
<li>New scenery objects in this version:
	<ul>
		<li>B747-400 (Multiple liveries)</li>
		<li>DC-9-10 (Northwest Airlines historical livery 1989-2003)</li>
