<h2>Instructions for Scenery Developers</h2>
<p>First, an important note regarding the licence:  Because you will be <strong>referencing</strong> rather than <strong>copying</strong> objects in the library, you do not need to contact anyone or get permission from anyone to use this library with your own sceneries, whether commercial or not.</p>

<h3>An Incredibly Quick Tutorial Using OverlayEditor</h3>

<p>Once you have installed the OpenSceneryX library in your X-Plane custom scenery folder, 'opensceneryx' will appear in the drop-down menu on the right hand side in OverlayEditor.  When you select this option, all the objects in the library are listed and you can select one and click the '+' sign to add it to your scenery in the normal way.  That's all you need to do.

<h3>What You Need To Do When Distributing Your Scenery</h3>
<p>The main problem you have is that if your users install your scenery package and your package references OpenSceneryX, then if a user doesn't have OpenSceneryX installed X-Plane will display an 'unable to locate object definition' error on startup and then quit.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, naturally you will want to instruct your users to install OpenSceneryX, and the best way to do this is to link to <a href='http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?autocom=dlmanager&do=viewfile&fid=0000'>the download page on X-plane.org</a>.</p>
<p>However, inevitably some users will forget to do this, misunderstand or simply ignore the instructions, so to avoid X-Plane throwing up errors, we have produced an empty version of the library, with invisible placeholder objects instead of the real objects.  This is called the <strong>Placeholder Library</strong>. The idea is that you include the placeholder library in the zip file for your scenery package, so X-Plane will not complain when it can't find OpenSceneryX.  Your scenery package will load correctly, but no OpenSceneryX objects will be seen.</p>
<p class="warning">Note 1: Please do not distribute the full version of OpenSceneryX with your scenery package.  If scenery authors do this, users will end up with multiple different versions of OpenSceneryX on their machines, and it will become a nightmare to maintain and manage. Please only distribute the placeholder library. (n.b. Additionally, if you are a commercial developer, you would be breaking the licence by including OpenSceneryX in your package). </p>
<p class="warning">Note 2: The placeholder library will only work on <strong>X-Plane v8.60 and above</strong>.  It uses a new feature of v8.60 that allows us to reduce the priority of the placeholder objects so that they are not used unless the full package is missing.  The main OpenSceneryX package should work on v8.50 and above, so if you want to distribute your scenery to v8.50 users, do not include the placeholder library and ensure they install the full library.</p>
<p>To include the placeholder library in your package:
<ol>
<li>Download the zip from <a href='http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?autocom=dlmanager&do=viewfile&fid=0000'>the download page for the <strong>placeholder library</strong> on X-plane.org</a>.</li>
<li>Extract the zip, it will create a folder titled 'OpenSceneryX-Placeholder'.</li>
<li>Copy the <strong>contents</strong> of this folder into your scenery package.</li>
</ol></p>
It's as simple as that!  There are only two problems you may come across:  Firstly, please ensure that the version of the placeholder library you include with your scenery is the same as the version of the full library you built your scenery with, otherwise users may get 'unable to locate object definition' errors on X-Plane startup.  Secondly, if you are building a scenery package <strong>that is also a library</strong>, you will have produced your own <tt>library.txt</tt> file.  In this case, simply copy-and-paste the contents of the OpenSceneryX placeholder <tt>library.txt</tt> file into yours, instead of copying the whole file.
